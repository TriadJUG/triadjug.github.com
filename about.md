TriadJUG is established to provide powerful resources relating to Java technologies from the server-side to IoT. We cater mostly to the NC Piedmont Triad area (Greensboro, Winston-Salem, High Point). One of the key goals of the Java User Group is to promote and facilitate collaboration and networking between its members.
