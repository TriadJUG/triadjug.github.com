Rapid change is happening in the IT industry. And for the Java IT Professional, that can be either (or both) exciting and/or nerve racking. The session will briefly dive into technologies prevalent a decade ago and how things have changed. And even though new platforms, coding techniques, and architecture patterns have emerged, **Java** is as strong as ever. The session will outline how the Java platform have adapted to support new languages, spawned new systems and frameworks for _Microservice Architectures_ and app containerization, further modularized to become more “lean” for IoT devices. Also, the session will dive to the tools that could help Java Developers, Architects, and Systems/Ops engineers take advantage of the agility of getting stuff out with the mantra of "Speed and Safety at Scale and in Harmony."

We'll also discuss the next steps for this _Java User Group_ and have a feel of what topics you want to cover (so that we can invite key speakers from LightBend, Oracle, Red Hat, etc), activities that we can undertake (i.e., Hackathons), and other fun stuff we can do.
